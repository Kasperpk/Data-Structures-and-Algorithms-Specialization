# Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization

This repository contains Python implementations of algorithms and data structures from the Data Structures and Algorithms Specialization course on Coursera.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main areas:

### üìä Algorithms
Located in the `algorithms/` folder:
- **`solutions/`** - Python implementation files organized by module
- **`notebooks/`** - Jupyter notebooks for documentation and experimentation

#### Algorithm Modules:
- **Module 1 - Algorithmic Warmup**: Basic algorithmic problems and complexity analysis
- **Module 3 - Greedy Algorithms**: Locally optimal choice algorithms
- **Module 4 - Divide and Conquer Algorithms**: Recursive problem-solving techniques  
- **Module 5 - Dynamic Programming**: Optimal substructure and overlapping subproblems

### üèóÔ∏è Data Structures
Located in the `data-structures/` folder:
- **`solutions/`** - Python implementation files for data structure problems
- **`notebooks/`** - Jupyter notebooks with detailed analysis and visualizations

#### Data Structure Topics:
- **Module 1 - Basic Data Structures**: Stacks, queues, trees, and hash tables

## Key Features

Each implementation includes:
- Comprehensive docstrings explaining algorithms
- Time and space complexity analysis
- Coursera-compatible input/output handling
- Multiple algorithm variants where applicable

## Usage

### Running Algorithm Solutions
Navigate to any algorithm module directory and run with standard input:
```bash
cd algorithms/solutions/"module 5 - Dynamic programming"
python3 money_change_dp.py < input.txt
```

### Working with Notebooks
The notebooks in both `algorithms/notebooks/` and `data-structures/notebooks/` provide:
- Interactive code examples
- Step-by-step algorithm explanations
- Visualization of algorithm behavior
- Comparison between different approaches

## Algorithm Highlights

**Dynamic Programming Module** implements core DP algorithms:
- Money Change (DP vs Greedy comparison)
- Primitive Calculator (minimum operations)
- Edit Distance (Levenshtein distance)
- Longest Common Subsequence (2 and 3 sequences)
- Knapsack (0/1 variant with optimizations)
- Placing Parentheses (expression optimization)
